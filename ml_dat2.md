## Steps
1. Define the problem (before the developing tool, what is your Aim)
2. AI app to understand the Dr.s writing (example)
3. Data collection (quality, data, statistics) (primary data)
4. Data gathering (like secondary data) (how much your data is good your model will be good)
5. Data Pre-processing (it is very crutial step, a ML engineer spend his/her 80% time on data pre-processing) 
6. To find out, after exploring the data, Anomalies, outliers, missing values, variables. 
7. This is called feature engineering, data wrangling, tidying up
8. Data -> ML -> (Decision) Outcome
9. Before ML modeling, must do the EDA / Data wrangling
10. Choose a model KNN, Linear Regression (ML Model is select base on the data type)
11. If data is Male / Female (Categorical) This is classifcation
12. If price of mobile is $450 (Numerical) This is Regression
13. It depend on the 1st question should we use Regression or Classification
14. There is also a clustering
15. Also, base look into that shoud we go with supervised or unsupervised learning
16. Spliting the data
17. Independent variable can be more than 1 and outcome is dependent variable
18. IV also called Predictors, Input or Features
19. DV is output, label outcome
20. There are training data usually 80% and test data is 20%
21. Metrices (R2, RMSE, MSE) tells how much model is accurate
22. Evaluating the model (choose model A, B, C and their R2 if 0.6, 0.7, 0.75 and MSE 1.22, 0.9, 0.001) base on this we can select the model which is best for the ML. 
23. If the perfromance couldn't be good on the base of the model then we use Hyper Parameter Tuning, This perform the all steps again and provide the good and best perfromance. 
24. Every model can perform its best, wif we know the background of the model, in-depth knowledge of the model.
25. Theoretical knowledge is necessary to know the model, if a = mx +b, and if we know the values of all parameters then the model perform its best.
26. Same model train on different sub datasets. this is called cross validation. this could remove the baisness and error. after this we finalize the model.
27. Finalize the model, check this model on multiple data and check its validation. after these confirmation and validation. 
28. Deploy the Model, these models will use in App, Webapp, softwares and ML OPS.
29. test, Retest the model, update the model, upgrade the version and this process will do again and again. 
30. You must embrace the model.
